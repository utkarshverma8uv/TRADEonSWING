This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast the opening stock price of a share using historical data spanning from 2005 to 2023. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture the temporal dependencies and patterns in stock price movements.
